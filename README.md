# Lendly

Lendly is a student-first platform that makes it easy for college students to lend, borrow, or sell items (like books, gadgets, and more) within their campus community. The app is designed to save money, reduce waste, and help students build trust and connections with each other.

## 👩‍🎓 Why Lendly?
- **Why buy, when you can borrow?**
- Most students have useful items lying unused—Lendly lets you share, earn, and help others.
- Verified student-only access ensures a safe, trusted environment.

- **Chat & Notifications:** Chat directly and get real-time updates on requests and activity.
